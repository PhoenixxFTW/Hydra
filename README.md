# Hydra - LoadRunner Vugen IDE

Hydra is a custom IDE designed to make correlations and parameterization easier and more efficient for your LoadRunner Vugen scripts, helping you optimize and streamline their development process. 
By providing advanced correlation and parameterization tools, along with support for multiple protocols, Hydra can help you achieve better results and reduce the time and effort required for manual script tuning.

## Features
Some of the key features of Hydra include:
- Script loading: Hydra allows you to load existing LoadRunner Vugen scripts, making it easy to import and modify your existing test cases.
- Correlation and parameterization: Hydra provides advanced tools for identifying and resolving correlation issues, as well as streamlining parameterization to improve script performance.
- Syntax highlighting: Hydra includes syntax highlighting for C code, making it easier to read and navigate your scripts.
- Integrated debugger: Hydra features an integrated debugger to help you quickly identify and troubleshoot script issues.
- Code generation: Hydra can generate custom code snippets and templates to simplify script development.
- Plugin support: Hydra can be extended with custom plugins and add-ons, allowing you to customize your workflow and integrate with other tools and platforms.
- Multiple protocols: Hydra supports multiple LoadRunner Vugen protocols, including Oracle, Java, TruClient, and Web/HTTP (with more protocols to be added in future releases).
- Export options: Hydra allows you to export your scripts as Vugen script files or as requests in various formats, including CURL and PowerShell.

## Future plans
We are continuously working to improve Hydra and plan to add new features in the future, including:
- Automation with OpenAI's GPT or other LLMs: We plan to incorporate machine learning models such as OpenAI's GPT or other LLMs to automate the correlation and parameterization process, saving you time and effort.
- Additional protocols: We plan to add support for additional LoadRunner Vugen protocols to further expand Hydra's capabilities.

## Getting started
Before using Hydra, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with LoadRunner Vugen's correlation and parameterization concepts. This will help you use Hydra more efficiently and take full advantage of its advanced tools and features.

To get started with Hydra, you'll need to download and install the IDE from the GitHub releases tab. Once installed, you can open your existing LoadRunner Vugen scripts or create new ones from scratch.
